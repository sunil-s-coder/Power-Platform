# Power Apps Roadmap

| Day | Focus Area                    | Key Learning Tasks & Objectives                                                                 |
|-----|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Environment Setup             | Sign up for a Microsoft 365 Developer Plan. Access the Power Apps Maker Portal and explore the sidebar navigation. |
| 2   | Data Architecture             | Learn to connect data sources. Create a SharePoint List or a Dataverse Table to act as your "database." Understand Columns (Fields) vs. Rows (Records). |
| 3   | Canvas App Basics             | Use "Start with Data" to auto-generate a 3-screen app. Learn to customize the Gallery (viewing list) and Edit Form (submitting data) controls. |
| 4   | Power Fx Formulas             | Master the logic language. Practice `Patch()` for custom saves, `Navigate()` for screen switching, and `Filter()` to search your data records. |
| 5   | Automation (Power Automate)   | Create a Cloud Flow. Set a trigger for "When a Power App calls a flow." Practice sending an automated Outlook email or Teams message when a button is clicked. |
| 6   | AI & Copilot                  | Use the Copilot side-pane to describe changes you want (e.g., "Add a button that clears the form"). Learn to use the AI Builder for basic text recognition. |
| 7   | Final Project                 | Build an Asset Tracker or Leave Request app from scratch. Test the end-to-end flow, publish the app, and share it with a test user. |
