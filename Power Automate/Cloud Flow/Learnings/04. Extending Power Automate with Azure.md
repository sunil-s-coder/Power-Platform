# Extending Power Automate Platform with Azure

## 1. [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/):
- **Azure Functions** let you run custom logic outside of Power Platform apps, helping keep them fast and stable.
- They can handle complex tasks and be exposed to Power Platform as **custom connectors**.
- Apps and flows can easily call these functions to extend functionality beyond built-in features.

---

## 2. [API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/):
- **Azure API Management** helps manage APIs across cloud and on-premises environments.
- It can export API definitions directly to the **Microsoft Power Platform**.
- Exported APIs become **custom connectors** that can be used in **Power Apps** and **Power Automate**.

## 3. [Service bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/)
- **Azure Service Bus** is a **reliable messaging service** enabling **real-time, asynchronous communication** across systems.  
- It supports **integration** with both **cloud** and **on-premises** environments in a **serverless, distributed** way.  
- **Dataverse** can **publish events** to Service Bus **queues** and **topics** automatically or via **custom logic**.  
- **Messages** are **stored** until the **receiver is ready**, allowing **loosely coupled** and more **resilient system designs**.  

---

## 4. [Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-grid/)
- **Event Grid** routes events from any source to any destination, enabling easy event-based app development.  
- It connects Microsoft Power Platform with Azure services like Azure Functions for automated workflows.  
- Event Grid simplifies and scales event routing, reducing the need for complex integration code.

## 5 [Logic apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/)
- **Logic Apps** is a cloud service for **automating** and **orchestrating workflows**, helping integrate apps, data, and services across organizations.
- **Power Automate** is built on **Logic Apps** and integrates closely with **Power Apps** and **Dataverse**.
- Logic Apps can **extend Power Platform** solutions when more advanced automation is needed, such as using the **Enterprise Integration Pack** or **SOAP connectors**.
- Compared to Power Automate, Logic Apps offers a **different deployment and pricing model**, which can be more **efficient** for some enterprise scenarios.

## 6. [AI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services?activetab=pivot%3Aazureopenaiservicetab)
- **Azure AI Services** provides a wide range of **AI and cognitive APIs** to build intelligent applications.
- **AI Builder** in Power Platform offers a **low-code** way to use some of these AI capabilities.
- When requirements go beyond AI Builder's limits, developers can **extend solutions** using **Azure AI Services**.
- These services include **APIs**, **SDKs**, and tools for adding AI features like **vision**, **speech**, **language**, **search**, and **decision-making**.
- Power Platform's **extensibility framework** allows integrating these AI features into apps and flows.

## 7. [Azure Data Lake and Azure Synapse analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/)
- Microsoft Power Platform supports **Azure Data Lake** using **Dataverse** and the **Common Data Model (CDM)**.
- This enables **advanced analytics** using tools like **Power BI**, **Azure Synapse**, and **Azure HDInsight**.
- **Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse** automatically handles **initial and incremental data writes**.
- **Data and metadata changes** in Dataverse are **pushed** to Azure Synapse and Data Lake without manual refresh.
- This **push-based integration** ensures near real-time data availability for analytics.

---

## 8. [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)
- **Dataverse** is built on top of the **Azure SQL Database engine**, offering a strong relational data foundation.
- It includes a **SQL data connection** that allows **read-only access** to Dataverse tables.
- **SQL Server developers** can use familiar SQL tools and syntax to work with Dataverse data efficiently.
- **Power Apps** and **Power Automate** can connect to **Azure SQL** using the **Azure SQL connector** for integration and automation.

## 9. Other Azure Services

Azure offers many services to **extend Power Platform functionality** when needed. Commonly used services include:

- **App Service** – for hosting **cloud apps** (web and mobile).
- **Identity Management** – using **Microsoft Entra ID** and **Microsoft Entra ID B2C** for secure access and authentication.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)** – enables integration with Power Platform solutions like **Dynamics 365 Field Service**.
- **DevOps** – provides tools for **continuous delivery** and application lifecycle management.
- **Developer Tools** – supports custom development and integration scenarios.
