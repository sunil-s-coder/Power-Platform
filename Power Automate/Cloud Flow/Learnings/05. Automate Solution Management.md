## Automate Solution Management

### Overview
- **Solutions** help organize app components and move them between environments.
- **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)** covers planning, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining apps.
- Tools like **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub** help automate ALM processes.

---

### Role of the Team
- A **solution architect** defines the ALM strategy.
- A **DevOps engineer** sets up automation.
- Team members use these tools to manage changes and track progress.
- Once work is complete, **automation** handles moving changes across environments.

---

### Why Automate?
- Ensures consistency and reduces human error.
- Continues working even when someone is unavailable.
- **Azure Pipelines** and **GitHub Actions** offer prebuilt Power Platform tasks/actions.

---

### Source Control and Solutions
- **Source control** (Azure DevOps or GitHub) tracks changes and supports rollback.
- Ensures development environments are **reproducible**.
- Solutions are **unpacked** before storing in source control for better change tracking.

---

### Common Automations
- Create new development environments from source control.
- Export changes and update source control.
- Run **Solution Checker** to detect issues early.
- Provision/de-provision environments.
- Run automated tests (e.g., Power Apps Test Studio).
- Build managed solutions for downstream deployment.
- Deploy to **Test** and **Production** environments.

---

### Phases of Automation
- **Initiate**: Set up or update environments.
- **Build**: Package and verify the solution.
- **Release**: Deploy solution to target environment.

---

## Power Platform Build Tools

- A set of tasks/actions to support ALM without writing custom scripts.
- Used in **Azure DevOps (tasks)** and **GitHub Actions (actions)**.

### Common Operations
- **Power Platform Checker**: Run static analysis on a solution.
- **Export Solution**: Export as unmanaged, managed, or both.
- **Import Solution**: Import into a target environment.
- **Unpack Solution**: Convert `.zip` into component files for source control.
- **Pack Solution**: Rebuild `.zip` from source control files.
- **Set Solution Version**: Maintain consistent versioning across releases.
- **Create/Delete/Copy Environments**: Manage environments automatically.
