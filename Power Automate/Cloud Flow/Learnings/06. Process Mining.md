# Process Mining

At its core, **process mining** involves extracting **actionable insights** from **event logs** generated by business systems.

It helps organizations:
- **Discover**, **monitor**, and **improve** real-world processes
- Gain a **clear, unbiased view** of how processes actually operate

## B. When to Use Process Mining

| **Effective When...**                                | **Not Effective When...**                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event data is available and reliable**             | **No access to event logs** (missing or incomplete data)         |
| **Processes are structured and repeatable**          | **Processes are unstructured or non-repetitive**                |
| **Processes follow clear, defined steps**            | **Process scope is unclear or not defined**                     |
| **There is time and technical skill available**      | **Resources (time, skills, tools) are limited**                 |
| **Organizations aim to improve efficiency**          | **Processes are too dynamic or change in real-time**            |

## C. Steps Involved in Process Mining

### **1. Data Extraction**
**Connectors:** Power Automate uses connectors for reliable **event data extraction** without manual intervention.

### **2. Process Discovery**
**Visual Process Models:** Algorithms are used to automatically generate **visual models** of **actual processes** from event logs.

### **3. Conformance Checking**
**Deviation Identification:** Once a process model is created, **conformance checking** compares it against an ideal or predefined version.

### **4. Process Enhancement**
**Process Improvement:** Based on insights from **discovery** and **conformance checking**, the next step is to **automate repetitive, slow, or error-prone tasks** using **RPA**, **Power Automate flows**, and **AI capabilities** to improve performance.

### **5. Continuous Monitoring and Analysis**
**Measure Performance with Metrics:** Continuously monitor workflow performance and generate insights through dashboards and reports.

### **6. Advanced Analytics**
**Process Improvement with AI:** Integrate with **AI Builder** or external AI services to predict delays, forecast trends, or recommend process changes.

## D. DMAIC Framework with Power Automate

**DMAIC** = Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control

### 1. Define
- Identify processes for optimization:
  - Already automated
  - Rich in event log data
  - High business impact
- Use Power Automate process mining to scope/select processes.

### 2. Measure
- Extract, clean, and validate data from systems (e.g., CRM, ERP).
- Power Automate connectors streamline data prep.

### 3. Analyze
- Use tools like:
  - **Process Compare**
  - **Rework Detector**
  - **Root Cause Analysis**
- Identify inefficiencies and deviations.

### 4. Improve
- Build/modify flows to fix issues.
- Create apps (Power Apps) to enhance workflows.
- Integrate with Teams/Outlook.

### 5. Control
- Monitor using:
  - Power BI dashboards
  - Alerts in Power Automate
- Continuously analyze and adjust as needed.

## E. How to Record a Process  
- Start from **Process mining > Recordings**, name your process, and click **Create**.  
- Select **Add a recording** to launch Power Automate for desktop and begin capturing steps.  
- Once done, click **Finish** to save and manage your recording under **Process mining > Processes**.

## F. Possible Statues for Process Recordings
- In progress
- Failed
- Not analyzed
- Ready to analyze
- Analyzed

## G. Edit and Prepare a Recording  
- Select **Edit** on a recording with status **Not analyzed** to group actions into activities.  
- Use **Add activity** to name and group steps, ensuring at least two activities per recording.  
- Toggle **Ready to analyze** to finalize and prepare the recording for process analysis.

## H. Analyze Your Process  
- Once recordings are grouped into activities, select **Analyze** and confirm to process data.  
- View results under **Analytics**, including process maps, variants, timings, and app usage.  
- Use color-coded visuals and variant filtering to identify bottlenecks and automation potential.
