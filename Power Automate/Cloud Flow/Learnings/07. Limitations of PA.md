# Power Automate Limits & Throttling

## API Throttling
- **600 API calls per connection per 60 seconds**.  
- All actions count toward limits, including:
  - Connector actions
  - HTTP actions
  - Built-in actions (Compose, Initialize variable, etc.)
  - Retries and pagination requests
  - Successful and failed actions

---

## Flow Run Limits

| Metric | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Runs every 5 minutes | 100,000 |
| Runs every 24 hours | Low: 10,000 <br> MediumLow1: 25,000 <br> MediumLow2: 100,000 <br> Medium: 125,000 <br> High: 500,000 |
| Concurrent outbound calls | Low: 500 <br> Others: 2,500 |
| Content throughput every 5 minutes | Low: 600 MB <br> Others: 6 GB |
| Content throughput every 24 hours | Low: 1 GB <br> MediumLow1/2, Medium: 10 GB <br> High: 50 GB |

## License-based API Request Limits

| License Plan | Daily API Requests |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Per-user | 5,000 per user |
| Per-flow | 15,000 per flow |

---

## Known Issues & Notes
- **SharePoint triggers**: Flows using “For a selected item/file” only show flows from the **default environment**.  
- **Default SharePoint flows** (e.g., Request sign-off) cannot be edited in the portal.  
- **Delegation limits** may affect dataset completeness in Microsoft Lists or SharePoint.  
- **CannotDisableTriggerConcurrency error**: Concurrency control can only be removed by exporting the flow and editing the JSON.

---

## On-Premises Connector
- Provides secure connection between on-premises data and cloud flows via a **gateway**.  
- Performance depends on local **internet speed**.  
- **Alternative:** Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute  
  - Extends on-premises networks into Microsoft cloud via **private connection**  
  - Provides faster and more reliable network to Microsoft 365 and Azure  
  - Offers primary and backup connections for redundancy

# Data Policies

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies act as guardrails to help prevent users from unintentionally exposing organizational data. These policies can be scoped at either the **environment level** or the **tenant level**, providing flexibility to balance protection with productivity.

---

## Policy Scope

- **Tenant-level policies**  
  - Can apply to:
    - All environments  
    - Selected environments  
    - All environments *except* those explicitly excluded  

- **Environment-level policies**  
  - Defined for one environment at a time  

---

## Connector Classification

DLP policies enforce rules by classifying connectors into groups:

- **Business** – Connectors in this group can only be used with other Business connectors in an app or flow.  
- **Non-Business** – Default group for all connectors when a new policy is created.  
- **Blocked** – Connectors in this group cannot be used at all.  

> 💡 By default, all connectors are placed in the **Non-Business** group. You can move them to **Business** or **Blocked** as needed.

---

## Managing Connectors

You can manage connector groups when creating or modifying a DLP policy in the **Microsoft Power Platform admin center**.

**Example:**  
If you place **SharePoint** and **Outlook** in the Business group, and **Twitter** in the Non-Business group:
- ✅ Makers can build flows using SharePoint + Outlook  
- ❌ Makers cannot build flows using SharePoint + Twitter  

This ensures that data cannot flow between connectors in different groups.

---

## Data Sharing Rules

- **Allowed:** Data can be shared among connectors *within the same group*.  
- **Restricted:** Data cannot be shared across connectors in *different groups*.
