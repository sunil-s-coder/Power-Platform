# Dataverse
Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that business applications use.

---

## A. Dataverse Characteristics:
- Dataverse stores data in a set of **tables**.
- Common terminologies in Dataverse:
  - **Table:** Entity
  - **Rows:** Record
  - **Columns:** Fields/Attributes
- Dataverse lets us create custom tables along with the standard tables it offers. It also allows us to populate data using **Power Query**.

## B. Benefits of Dataverse:

### 1. Work with any type of data
- It can work with major data technologies:
  - Relational
  - Non-relational
  - File
  - Image
  - Search
  - Data lake
- **Visual Designer:** Makes it easy to quickly define tables, relationships, business rules, forms, views, and workflows in Dataverse.
- **Virtual tables:** Map data in an external data source so that it appears to exist in Dataverse.

### 2. Work with any type of app
- **Power Apps (internal apps):** Power Apps can integrate with Dataverse seamlessly for accessing data.
- **Custom Apps (external apps):** External apps can access data from Dataverse via REST API.

### 3. Built-in security model
- Dataverse uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- It supports fine-grained security at row, column, and cross-table levels.
- Security roles can be assigned to users, teams, or business units.
- Two hierarchy models:
  - **Manager hierarchy:** Managers can access reports data if they're in the same or parent business unit.
  - **Position hierarchy:** Allows data access across business units.

## C. Types of extensibility

### 1. Extending the user experience of Power Apps
- **Power Apps Component Framework (PCF):** Use PCF to create custom code components, if required functionality not offered by exiting connectors.
- **[Microsoft Power Fx:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/power-fx/overview/)** Canvas applications can be edited with Power Fx and can be debugged via [Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview/)
- **Client Script:** TypeScript is recommended for scripting, and since it's transpiled to JavaScript, both are referred to as "client script."

### 2. Extending Dataverse
- **Plug-in:** The extensibility in Dataverse can be acheived via plug-in

## D. Dataverse solutions
- **Solutions** in Dataverse are containers used to package and move apps and components (like tables, flows, site maps) across environments.
- They support **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)**, enabling automation and deployment via tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub.

# Common Data Model overview
- **Common Data Model (CDM)** defines standard data structures (like Account and Contact) used in Dataverse and Dynamics 365.
- Some standard entities are built into Dataverse; others are added through apps or industry solutions.
- CDM helps standardize data, making it easier to build, extend, and integrate apps across the Microsoft ecosystem.
