# Key Concepts

## Triggers
You can think of the **trigger** as the starting action for the flow.  
The trigger can be something like:
- A new email arriving in your inbox  
- A new item being added to a list in Microsoft Lists

---

## Actions
**Actions** are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked.  
For example:
- The new email trigger can start the action of creating a new file on OneDrive  
- Other examples of actions include:
  - Sending an email  
  - Posting a tweet  
  - Starting an approval

## Connections
The Embedded connections that are used in a flow fall into two categories:
- **Connections in Use:** These connections are used in the flow.
- **Other:** These connections have been defined for the flow, but they aren't used in it. If you stop using a `Connection in Use` in a flow, that connection appears in the `Other` connections list.

## Shared Flow Ownership in Power Automate
- **Multiple users can co-own and manage a flow**, allowing for collaborative development and maintenance.
- **If the original creator leaves the organization**, other owners can continue to run and maintain the flow without interruption.
- **All owners have full access** to view history, edit the flow, manage properties, add or remove owners, and delete the flow.
- **Shared flows appear under the `Shared with me` tab**, and are **no longer listed in the `Cloud flows` tab** for non-creators.
- **Shared connections are limited to the flow where they were created** and **cannot be reused across other flows**.
- **Owners can use existing shared connections**, but **cannot modify the credentials** if those were created by another owner.
- **If an owner with active credentials is removed**, be sure to **update the connections** to prevent flow failures.

## Troubleshooting Flows in Power Automate
- Power Automate sends a **weekly email** summarizing any flow failures.
- To investigate:
  1. Go to **Power Automate Home**.
  2. Select **Cloud flow activity** from the left menu.
  3. Choose the failed flow to view its **run history**.
  4. Look for steps marked with a **red exclamation mark (!)** and open them to view detailed error messages.
