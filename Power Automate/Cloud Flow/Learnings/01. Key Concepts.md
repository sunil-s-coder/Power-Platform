# Key Concepts

## Triggers
You can think of the **trigger** as the starting action for the flow.  
The trigger can be something like:
- A new email arriving in your inbox  
- A new item being added to a list in Microsoft Lists

---

## Actions
**Actions** are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked.  
For example:
- The new email trigger can start the action of creating a new file on OneDrive  
- Other examples of actions include:
  - Sending an email  
  - Posting a tweet  
  - Starting an approval

---

## Connections
The Embedded connections that are used in a flow fall into two categories:
- **Connections in Use:** These connections are used in the flow.
- **Other:** These connections have been defined for the flow, but they aren't used in it. If you stop using a `Connection in Use` in a flow, that connection appears in the `Other` connections list.

## Shared Flow Ownership in Power Automate
- **Multiple users can co-own and manage a flow**, allowing for collaborative development and maintenance.
- **If the original creator leaves the organization**, other owners can continue to run and maintain the flow without interruption.
- **All owners have full access** to view history, edit the flow, manage properties, add or remove owners, and delete the flow.
- **Shared flows appear under the `Shared with me` tab**, and are **no longer listed in the `Cloud flows` tab** for non-creators.
- **Shared connections are limited to the flow where they were created** and **cannot be reused across other flows**.
- **Owners can use existing shared connections**, but **cannot modify the credentials** if those were created by another owner.
- **If an owner with active credentials is removed**, be sure to **update the connections** to prevent flow failures.

## Troubleshooting Flows in Power Automate
- Power Automate sends a **weekly email** summarizing any flow failures.
- To investigate:
    1. Open [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/).
    2. Select the **More (...)** option from the left-hand navigation menu.
    3. Click on **Cloud flow activity**.
        - On mobile: tap the **Activity** tab.
        - If you don’t see **Cloud flow activity**, scroll to the bottom of the **More** menu and select **Discover all**, then choose **Cloud flow activity** from the list.
    4. Locate the failed flow run in the list.
    5. Click the run to open its details.
    6. Identify the step(s) with the red exclamation mark (!) icon.
    7. Review the error message to confirm it’s a **500** or **502** error.
    8. Select **Resubmit** to retry the flow.
