# Key Concepts

## Triggers
You can think of the **trigger** as the starting action for the flow.  
The trigger can be something like:
- A new email arriving in your inbox  
- A new item being added to a list in Microsoft Lists

## Actions
**Actions** are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked.  
For example:
- The new email trigger can start the action of creating a new file on OneDrive  
- Other examples of actions include:
  - Sending an email  
  - Posting a tweet  
  - Starting an approval

## Connections
The Embedded connections that are used in a flow fall into two categories:
- **Connections in Use:** These connections are used in the flow.
- **Other:** These connections have been defined for the flow, but they aren't used in it. If you stop using a `Connection in Use` in a flow, that connection appears in the `Other` connections list.
