# Incoming Email Monitoring Flow ‚Äì Power Automate

This Power Automate flow monitors an **Outlook inbox folder** for incoming emails that contain the subject `"Daily Report"` and are sent from a **specific email address**. When such an email is received, the flow extracts any attachments and uploads them to a designated **SharePoint document library**.

---

## Project Description

The flow runs automatically when a new email arrives in a specified Outlook folder. It performs the following actions:

1. **Monitors incoming emails** with the subject containing `"Daily Report"` and a specified sender's email ID.
2. **Loops through each attachment** in the matched email.
3. **Uploads the attachments** to a target **SharePoint site** and folder.

This automation helps streamline the processing of daily report emails without manual download/upload steps.

## Trigger:

### üìé Notes

- The flow uses the **‚ÄúWhen a new email arrives (V3)‚Äù** trigger in Outlook.
- It checks both the **subject line** and **sender's address** for filtering.
- Only emails matching **both** conditions will be processed.
- Each attachment is uploaded with its original filename unless modified in the flow.
